# Kata Anagrams

The challenge is fairly simple: given a file containing one word per line, print out all the combinations 
of words that are anagrams; each line in the output contains all the words from the input that are anagrams 
of each other. For example, your program might include in its output:

	kinship pinkish
	enlist inlets listen silent
	boaster boaters borates
	fresher refresh
	sinks skins
	knits stink
	rots sort

For added programming pleasure, find the longest words that are anagrams, and find the set of anagrams 
containing the most words.
